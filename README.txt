To Run:

1.Open Terminal in the same folder ,Write command 'npm install' to install all the dependencies
2.Write Command  'node mail' to Run


Assumptions:

If we dont want to schedule mail and If the date and time are not to be given , then we have to enter 00/00/00.
6.Sending Email will not have time Restrictions.-This is mentioned in the description ... so not using timezone to send mails in the code.
The program needs to run until the scheduled date to send the actual scheduled mail(as if its a server, otherwise the scheduled mail wont be sent )
